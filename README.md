The line is located in the middle of the page. When button is pressed all dots start moving randomly to the left or to the right border of the page with the speed 5 px per second. When the Start is pressed the stopwatch launches a countdown. Stopwatch stops when the last dot reaches the screen border. 

When Start button is pressed again the script restarts.
